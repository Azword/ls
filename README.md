# LS command line

For our first year into Epitech, we should reproduce the famous 'ls' command, in C.
I was pretty young in C, so this code will not represent my actual skill in this programming langage.

## Getting Started

If you are a bit curious you probably want to test my program.
First of all you need to be on Linux, next i let you read the 'Prequisites'.

### Prerequisites

You need a compilator for C :

```
$ gcc -v
        gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Linux) 
```
or even
```
$ clang v
        clang version 3.8.0-Linux (tags/RELEASE_380/final)
```

### Installing

It's a basic Makefile, so it's easy, simply do :

```
$ make
```

And now you have the binary in the root dir.

## Built With

* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) - The compilator used

## Authors

* **TREHOUT Nathan** - *All the project* - [Enoviah](http://enoviah.fr)

## Acknowledgments

* I was a beginner in C
* You can see a beautiful Segmentation Fault if you do something big like :
```
$ ls -l -R /
```
* You also can see a nice Malloc, but i will not said where.
